# FiveM Play-Time Bot

A Discord Bot to check a player's playtime within your FiveM Server.

## Requirements

### [Node JS](https://nodejs.dev/download/)

### [Prefech Play-Time FiveM](https://github.com/prefech/Prefech_playTime)

## Project Setup

### Edit `config.js` to your needs!

### Install all Packages

```
npm install
```

### Start Bot

```
node index.js
```

## How to Host

You can host this bot yourself on a VPS if your FiveM server is already on one. Yet if you are using providers who don't allow you to run anything other than the FiveM Server, you will need to purchase seperate Discord Bot Hosting which does not cost much.  
I personally recommend [Snowside Hosting](https://hypnoticsiege.codes/hosting), where you can get bot hosting for very cheap. (Use code FAXES or HYPERZ for 25% off!)
